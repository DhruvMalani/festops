# FestOps

FestOps is an incident management and dispatch platform for a large cultural festival. It accepts emergency SOS reports, automatically triages each one into a category and severity, dispatches the best-suited responder using a proximity/skill/load scoring model, tracks every incident through a strict lifecycle state machine, and persists a full audit trail. It also includes an attendee-facing "concierge" that surfaces nearby events starting soon, a Swing operations dashboard, and a pluggable LLM-backed triage strategy.

## The problem it solves

At a festival with tens of thousands of attendees spread across many venues, incidents (medical emergencies, fires, security situations, logistics failures) arrive faster than a human dispatcher can manually classify, prioritize, and assign. FestOps automates the hot path: an SOS lands on a queue, is classified and assigned to the nearest qualified, least-loaded responder within milliseconds, and is escalated automatically if it breaches its service-level agreement (SLA). The result is faster response times, consistent prioritization, and a complete, queryable record of who did what and when.

## Tech stack

- **Java 17** — records, sealed-style hierarchies, switch expressions, text blocks
- **Spring Boot 3.3** — REST API (`spring-boot-starter-web`), dependency injection, lifecycle management
- **Java Swing** — desktop operations dashboard (`OperationsDashboard`)
- **H2 (embedded) + plain JDBC** — audit log persistence via `DriverManager`/`PreparedStatement`/`ResultSet`
- **Anthropic Messages API** — optional LLM-backed triage (`java.net.http.HttpClient` + Gson), key read from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **Gson 2.11** — JSON (de)serialization for the LLM client and CSV-free data interchange
- **JUnit 5 (Jupiter)** — unit tests for the state machine, dispatcher, triage, and geo utilities

## Running locally

### Prerequisites
- **JDK 17+** (the project targets Java 17 bytecode; it compiles and runs on newer JDKs too)
- **Maven 3.9+**
- *(optional)* an **Anthropic API key** for LLM triage — without it, triage falls back to the rule-based strategy

### Build
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

### Run the REST server
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The API comes up on `http://localhost:8080`. The H2 console is at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` (JDBC URL `jdbc:h2:mem:festops`, user `sa`, no password).

To enable LLM-backed triage instead of the regex rules:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...      # never commit this
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--festops.triage.mode=agentic
```

### Run the standalone pipeline demo (`DemoRunner`, no server)
```bash
mvn clean compile
mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=target/cp.txt
java -cp "target/classes:$(cat target/cp.txt)" com.festops.ui.DemoRunner
```

### Run the Swing dashboard (server must be running)
```bash
mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=target/cp.txt
java -cp "target/classes:$(cat target/cp.txt)" com.festops.ui.DashboardApp
```

### Run the tests
```bash
mvn test
```

## REST API

All paths are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

### Submit an SOS report (async intake)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sos \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"reporterId":"u1","description":"Someone collapsed and is bleeding","latitude":28.3635,"longitude":75.5870}'
# -> 202 Accepted  {"incidentId":"INC-1","status":"QUEUED","message":"SOS accepted for processing"}
```

### List all incidents
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/incidents
```

### Get one incident (with audit trail)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/incidents/INC-1
```

### Transition an incident's lifecycle
`action` ∈ `acknowledge | respond | resolve | escalate`.
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/v1/incidents/INC-1/status \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action":"acknowledge"}'
# invalid transition -> 409, unknown action -> 400, unknown id -> 404
```

### List responders
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/responders
```

### Nearby responders (ranked by proximity, optional skill filter)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/responders/nearby?lat=28.3630&lng=75.5870&skill=medical"
```

### Update responder availability
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/v1/responders/R4/status \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"available":false}'
```

### Report a user location ping
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/location \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"userId":"u1","latitude":28.3635,"longitude":75.5870}'
```

### Nearby upcoming events (concierge)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/events/nearby?lat=28.3635&lng=75.5870&tags=tech,coding"
```

## Design patterns used

| Pattern | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **State** | `state/*` driven by `Incident` | Each lifecycle state is its own class that knows its legal transitions; illegal moves throw `InvalidStateTransitionException`. Adding a state doesn't touch the others. |
| **Strategy** | `triage/TriageStrategy` with `RuleBasedTriageStrategy` / `AgenticTriageStrategy` | Triage algorithm is swappable at runtime via the `festops.triage.mode` flag without changing callers. |
| **Factory** | `factory/IncidentFactory` | Centralizes construction of the correct `Incident` subclass from an `IncidentType`. |
| **Observer** | `model/IncidentObserver` + `service/AuditLogObserver` | Incidents notify observers on every state change; the audit observer persists transitions to H2 — decoupled from the lifecycle logic. |
| **Producer–Consumer** | `service/FestOpsService` (`BlockingQueue` + `ExecutorService`) | Decouples API response time from processing: the controller enqueues and returns `202` immediately; a consumer thread triages/dispatches/stores. |
| **DAO** | `dao/AuditDAO`, `dao/ResponderCsvLoader` | Isolates persistence (JDBC, CSV) from business logic. |
| **DTO** | `controller/dto/*` | Decouples the wire format from domain entities, so internal state (lifecycle objects, observers) is never serialized. |

## Advanced Java features used

- **`java.util.concurrent`** — `LinkedBlockingQueue` for SOS intake, `ExecutorService` (single consumer thread), `ScheduledExecutorService` for the 30s SLA monitor, and `ConcurrentHashMap` for incident/responder/location registries. Chosen so the API thread, consumer thread, and scheduler can share state safely without blocking the request path.
- **`CompletableFuture` with `orTimeout`** — wraps the Anthropic API call in `AgenticTriageStrategy` with a hard 5-second timeout and graceful fallback, so an unreachable/slow LLM never stalls triage.
- **`java.net.http.HttpClient`** — non-blocking-capable HTTP client used both by the LLM triage strategy and the Swing dashboard (no third-party HTTP dependency).
- **`SwingWorker` + `javax.swing.Timer`** — the dashboard fetches off the Event Dispatch Thread and auto-refreshes every 5s, so the UI never freezes.
- **Records** — DTOs, `RankedEvent`, `UserLocation`, `SosReport` use records for concise, immutable carriers.
- **Switch expressions & text blocks** — used in the factory, severity colouring, and the LLM system prompt.
- **`volatile` + `synchronized`** — `Responder.available` is `volatile` and load mutations are synchronized so dispatch (consumer thread) and availability updates (HTTP threads) are memory-safe.
- **Regex `Pattern`/`Matcher`** — compiled, case-insensitive, priority-ordered keyword classification in `RuleBasedTriageStrategy`.
- **Try-with-resources** — JDBC connections/statements/result sets in `AuditDAO` and `BufferedReader` in the CSV loaders.

## OOP design — the incident inheritance hierarchy

The core of the domain is an **abstract `Incident` base class** with four concrete subclasses:

```
                       Incident (abstract)
                       ├─ id, description, lat/lng, severity, reportedAt
                       ├─ state machine (acknowledge/respond/resolve/escalate)
                       ├─ observer registration + notification
                       └─ abstract: getType(), defaultSeverity(),
                                    requiredSkill(), slaSeconds()
        ┌───────────────────┬───────────────┴───────┬───────────────────┐
 MedicalIncident     SecurityIncident          FireIncident       LogisticsIncident
 CRITICAL/medical    HIGH/security             CRITICAL/fire      LOW/maintenance
 SLA 120s            SLA 180s                  SLA 90s            SLA 600s
```

`Incident` holds everything common to all incidents — identity, location, the lifecycle state object, and the observer list — and implements the transition logic **once**. What differs per category is expressed through four **abstract methods** the subclasses must override:

- `getType()` — the `IncidentType` enum value
- `defaultSeverity()` — the `Severity` assigned at creation
- `requiredSkill()` — the responder skill the dispatcher matches against
- `slaSeconds()` — the SLA window the monitor enforces

This is **polymorphism in action**: the `Dispatcher`, `FestOpsService` SLA monitor, and `IncidentFactory` all operate on the `Incident` abstraction and call these methods without knowing the concrete type. Adding a new incident category (say, `WeatherIncident`) means writing one subclass and one factory case — no existing code changes. Severity is intentionally derived from the subclass rather than stored as free data, so a `FireIncident` is *always* CRITICAL by construction.

The lifecycle itself is **not** modeled with inheritance but with the **State pattern** (composition): an `Incident` *has-a* `IncidentState`, and delegates transitions to it. This keeps the "what kind of incident" axis (inheritance) cleanly separate from the "what stage is it in" axis (state objects).

## Testing

`mvn test` runs 28 JUnit 5 tests covering: every valid/invalid state transition, dispatcher scoring (skill, proximity, load) and the no-responder failure, rule-based triage classification + severity, and Haversine distances against known reference values.
